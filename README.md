### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description
In this project, I have used Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States 
(Chicago, New York City, and Washington) by computing a variety of descriptive statistics.
After introducing the needed input (the city to analyze, the month, or all the months and the day or all the days) the code provides the following information:
###### 1 Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time) 
most common month
most common day of week
most common hour of day
###### 2 Popular stations and trip
most common start station
most common end station
most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)
###### 3 Trip duration
total travel time
average travel time
###### 4 User info
counts of each user type
counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)
